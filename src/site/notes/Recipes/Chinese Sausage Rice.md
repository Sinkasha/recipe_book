3. Cover the rice in water so it just barely covers the rice. 
4. Cook covered until the water boils, about 5 minutes. 
5. Open the lid and mix up the rice and then poke holes in it with a chopstick. 
6. Cover in the sausages, pork belly, sliced shitake mushrooms, and corn. 
7. Close the lid, pour oil over the lid's edges and heat up the edges rotationally to create crispy rice. Cook for 8 minutes over low heat. 
8. In another pan, put 30 mL light soy sauce, 10 mL dark soy sauce, 10 mL oyster sauce, 3g white sugar, 3g white pepper powder, 1 mL sesame oil, and 60 mL water. Heat until boiling over medium heat. 
9. Pour over the rice. Top with some chopped scallions. 
10. Mix and eat!
