# Hong Kong Style Mango Pancake
### Ingredients
##### Crepes
- 3 extra large eggs (About 63g each with egg shell)
- 120 g cake flour (1 cup; Can be substituted with 95g all purpose flour + 25g cornstarch)
{ #1}

- 40 g sugar (3½ tbsps)
- 380 g milk (1½ cup) (can use unsweetened plant-based alternatives)
- 30 g unsalted butter (2 tbsps; Melted in microwave or over hot water bath.) (can be substituted with equal amount of vegetable oil)
##### Filling
- 450 g heavy whipping cream (16oz)
- 45 g powdered sugar (3½ tbsps; Or 3 tbsps of granulated sugar)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract (Optional)
- 6 ripe mangoes (Can also use strawberries or other fruits of your choice.)
### Instructions
1.  In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, then add the melted butter and milk. Mix using a whisk until everything is well combined.
2. In another mixing bowl, whisk together the cake flour and sugar until well combined. Pour the dry ingredients into the bowl with the wet ingredients. Stir until just combined. Do not overmix; a few lumps are okay.
3. Position a fine mesh strainer over a bowl and strain the batter to get rid of any lumps.
4. Warm a nonstick pan over medium heat. Pour approximately ¼ cup of batter onto the pan for each crepe. Swirl the pan quickly before the batter sets to ensure it spreads evenly across the bottom. Cook until the pancake just sets, about 2-3 minutes. Avoid overcooking, as bubbles forming on the crepe can lead to a coarser, less tender texture.
5. Invert the pan over a plate lined with parchment paper, with the crepe facing down. Use a spatula to gently loosen the edges of the crepe, allowing it to naturally release from the pan and onto the plate. Once it has cooled enough to handle, carefully lift the edges of the crepe with your hands and evenly spread it out on the plate.
6. Return the pan to the stovetop and continue cooking until all the batter is used. Once cooked, stack each crepe atop the previously cooked ones on the plate. (No need to worry about them sticking together; the butter in the batter facilitates easy separation of each layer of crepe without any sticking.) Cover the cooked crepes with plastic food wrap and refrigerate them to cool.
7. In a large mixing bowl, combine heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and optionally, vanilla extract. Use electric hand mixers or a stand mixer to whip until stiff peaks form.
8. Peel the mangoes, cut each of them into two big chunks.
9. Cover your work surface with food wrap. Lay a crepe on top and spoon a dollop of cream onto the center of the crepe. Spread the cream to match the size and thickness of the mango piece. Position a mango chunk on top of the cream. Fold the four edges of the crepe toward the center to cover the mango. Optionally, apply a small amount of cream to the edges (like applying glue) for better sealing. Flip the wrapped mango pancake so that the better-looking side is facing upwards.
10. Repeat with the assembling step with the rest of the crepes and filling. Enjoy!
