# Limonade
### Ingredients
- 4 limes, plus more for garnish
- 6 ounces sweetened condensed milk
- ¼ cup granulated sugar
- ice
- spirit of choice
### Instructions
1. Wash the limes well, then cut off the ends and cut them into quarters. Add them into a high power blender with the sweetened condensed milk, sugar, about 3 cups ice, and 3 cups water. Blend for about 20 seconds (you don’t want to overblend). 
   Note: Straining after blending but before adding the condensed milk may help remove some of the bitter flavor. 
2. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer. Serve over ice with a shot or 2 of your favorite spirit. 
3. Use a straw to mix the alcohol in and garnish with a lime wedge. Enjoy!
