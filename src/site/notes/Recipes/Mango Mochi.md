# Mango Mochi
### Ingredients
##### Mochi
- 110 g glutinous rice flour
- 30 g cornstarch
- 40 g granulated sugar
- 185 ml milk
- 15 g unsalted butter
- 10 g pumpkin powder
##### Filling
- 300 ml heavy cream
- 30 g granulated sugar
- Fresh mango cubes
### Instructions
1. In a clean bowl (microwave-safe), mix well glutinous rice flour, cornstarch, granulated sugar, pumpkin powder and milk until smooth. Sift once, cover it with microwave-safe plastic wrap, prick some holes on the plastic wrap, and steam until fully cooked (about 20-30 minutes). Or you can microwave it until fully cooked (about 3 minutes).
   When fully cooked, the batter turns into solid dough. There is no floating flour liquid inside the dough and the color is translucent. 
2. Transfer the dough into the stand mixer bowl, add in unsalted butter, and beat until well combined and dough becomes soft and stretchy.
3. In a clean bowl, bring together heavy cream and sugar and use a hand mixer to beat until stiff peaks form. Transfer into a piping bag and keep it cool in the fridge.
4. Dust the working surface and the dough with more cooked glutinous rice flour, so it wonâ€™t be too sticky. Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces, and roll them into 6 round flat sheets. Put in cream filling and fresh mango cubes, wrap it up, and put in a cupcake liner. Let them cool in the fridge for 30 minutes and serve.
