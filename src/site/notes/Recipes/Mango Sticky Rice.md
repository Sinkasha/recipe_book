# Mango Sticky Rice
### Ingredients
- 1 ½ cups glutinous rice  
- 1 ½ cups unsweetened coconut milk  
- ¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar  
- ¼ teaspoon salt  
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted lightly

### Instructions
1. Rinse the rice thoroughly in cold water until it’s clear. Then, soak let it soak overnight, for a minimum of 10 hours.  
2. Once soaked, drain the rice thoroughly using a strainer. Line a bamboo steamer with cheese cloth and spread the rice evenly on it. Fill a pot with water, ensuring there’s at least a 2-inch gap. 
3. While the rice is cooking, in a small saucepan, bring 1 cup of coconut milk to a boil with ¼ cup of sugar and ¼ teaspoon salt, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely. Remove from heat and keep the mixture warm.  
4. Transfer the cooked rice to a bowl and fold in the coconut-milk mixture and allow the rice to rest for 30 minutes
5. In a clean small saucepan, gently simmer the remaining 1/2 cup of coconut milk with the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar, stirring occasionally, for about 1 minute. Transfer the sauce to a small bowl and allow to cool down.
##### Onigiri Variation
1. Cut the mango into shapes suitable for both the large and small onigiri molds 
2. Assemble the mango sticky rice onigiri by placing a slice of mango into the mold, covering it with sticky rice, and adding another mango slice on top, allowing it to protrude slightly from the mold. Carefully press down and remove the mold.  
3. Arrange the mango sticky rice onigiri on a plate and serve alongside the chilled coconut sauce.
