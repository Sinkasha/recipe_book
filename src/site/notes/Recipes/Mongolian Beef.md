# Mongolian Beef
### Ingredients
- 1 carrot, peeled and julienned
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced into strips
- 1 tbsp unsalted butter
- 2 tbsp neutral oil, divided [^1]
- 1 lb. flank steak, thinly sliced against the grain [^2]
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- ⅓ cup green onions, thickly sliced (from 4 stems)
- 1 tsp sesame seeds, optional garnish
##### Sauce Ingredients
- 1 tsp fresh ginger, peeled and grated
- 4 garlic cloves, peeled and grated
- ⅓ cup brown sugar (packed)
- ⅓ cup water
- ⅓ cup low-sodium soy sauce [^3]
- 1 tsp Sriracha, or added to taste
### Instructions
1. Place beef slices in a bowl, add cornstarch and stir to completely coat.
2. In a bowl, combine the ingredients for the sauce and stir until well combined, set aside.
3. In a large skillet or wok, heat 1 tbsp oil with 1 tbsp butter over medium/high heat. Once the skillet is hot, add the carrot and peppers and stir fry until crisp-tender or to your desired tenderness, stirring frequently. Remove the vegetables to a separate plate.
4. Increase to high heat and add 1 tbsp oil. Once hot, add the beef and sear for about 3 minutes per side to create a crispy coating. Add more oil if the skillet seems dry. Do not crowd the pan and cook the beef in batches if needed. Pay attention to it while cooking to make sure it fries properly or else it won't be crispy. 
5. Add the vegetables back into the skillet with the green onion. Add the sauce and stir to combine. Turn heat to medium/low and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Garnish with sesame seeds if desired and serve.

[^1]: Use an oil with a high smoke point such as peanut oil, canola oil, vegetable oil, avocado oil, or extra light olive oil
[^2]: You can also use top sirloin, skirt steak, flat iron steak, top round, or even rib eye steak. Cut the beef into thin slices across the grain. If you freeze the steak for 30 minutes, it will be easier to thinly slice.
[^3]: Use Tamari Sauce for gluten-free Mongolian Beef. If using regular soy sauce, add it to taste since it has more salt.
