# Peach Puff Pastry Roses
### Ingredients
- Puff pastry sheet  
- 2-4 peaches, depending on size  
- Cooking spray or more butter, for coating the Minis (small Le Creuset pots)
- 5 tbsp butter 
- Cinnamon sugar (as much or as little as you want)
- Egg wash
- Powdered sugar
- 1 Tbsp hot honey
### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400F. Add cooking spray to Mini or generously coat Mini in butter and then add sugar. Shake Mini so sugar sticks to all the butter. Make sure everything is coated well so that the rose doesn’t stick.  
2. Thinly slice your peaches and set aside. Make your hot honey brown butter by adding butter to pan and cook, stirring often until butter starts to caramelize and brown, about 7-8 min. Remove from heat and add in hot honey. Stir until combined.  
3. Make your cinnamon sugar by combining sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.  
4. Roll out puff pastry dough until it’s about ⅛ inch thick and then cut into strips about 3 inches wide and 12 inches long.
5. Brush dough with hot honey brown butter and then top with cinnamon sugar. Place peach slices along the top of dough along the edge, overlapping the slices slightly, about 2 rows. Peach slices should be sticking out over the edge of the dough. Then fold the bottom of the dough over the slices. Whisk egg and water and brush surface of dough with egg wash.  
6. Roll dough to form a rose and transfer to the Mini. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Bake for about 40-45 min or until dough is cooked. Remove and dust with confectioners’ sugar. Enjoy!
