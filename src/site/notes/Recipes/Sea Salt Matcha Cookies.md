# Sea Salt Matcha Cookies
### Ingredients
- 1 stick of unsalted butter
- 200g all-purpose flour
- ½ tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp baking soda
- 1 tbsp matcha
- ½ tsp flakey salt
- 200g granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 tsp vanilla bean paste
- 200g mascarpone
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 75g powdered sugar
- 20g honey
- 120g heavy cream
### Instructions
##### Cookie  
1. Melt 110g (1 stick) of unsalted butter in microwave then place in fridge to cool  
2. While butter is cooling, start mixing your dry ingredients: 200g all-purpose flour, ½ tsp baking powder, ½ tsp baking soda, 1 tbsp matcha, ½ tsp flakey salt  
3. Once butter is cooled to room temperature, add 200g granulated sugar and mix. Then, add in 1 large egg, 1 tsp vanilla bean paste.  
4. Slowly mix in dry ingredients to wet ingredients until well incorporated.  
5. Roll your cookie dough and flatten, then place in fridge for about 30 minutes.  
6. Preheat oven to 355F. Once ready, bake cookies for 8-10 minutes. 9 minutes worked best for my oven.  
7. Once baked, let them cool completely on a cooling rack.  
##### Mascarpone Cream  
1. In a bowl, use an electric mixer to combine 200g mascarpone, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 75g powdered sugar, 20g honey, 120g heavy cream until stiff peaks form.  
2. Once cookies are cooled, use a piping kit or a ziploc bag to swirl cream on top of cookies.  
3. Top with a matcha dusting and a pinch of flakey salt.
