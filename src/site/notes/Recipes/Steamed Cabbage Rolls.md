# Steamed Cabbage Rolls
### Ingredients
- Napa cabbage
- Pork (ground)
- Green onions
- Ginger
- Light soy sauce
- Salt
- Chicken essence
- Pepper
- Oyster sauce
- Starch
- Baizhuozhi (A type of soy sauce?)
### Instructions
1. Clean, cut off the head, and peel some leaves off of the napa cabbage. The number of leaves dictate the number of rolls. 
2. Ground the pork, then add diced ginger and green onions (diced really small), light soy sauce, salt, chicken essence, pepper, oyster sauce, and starch. Mix very well. 
3. Put the cabbage in boiling water for 30 seconds, then remove. 
4. Take some ground pork and wrap it in the cabbage so it makes a neat cylindrical roll. 
5. Put all of them on a plate, and steam for 10 minutes. 
6. Garnish with thin pepper slices and green onions. 
7. Pour boiling oil over the top. Then pour some baizhuozhi over the top. Serve.
