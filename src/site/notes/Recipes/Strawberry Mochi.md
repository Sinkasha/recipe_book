# Strawberry Mochi
### Ingredients
##### Mochi
- 110 g glutinous rice flour
- 30 g cornstarch
- 30 g granulated sugar
- 170 ml milk
- 20 g unsalted butter
- Red food coloring
##### Filling
- Whipped Cream:
	- 260 g heavy cream
	- 50 g cream cheese
	- 30 g granulated sugar
- Strawberry Sauce:
	- 300 g fresh strawberries (chopped)
	- 50 g sugar
	- 1 tbsp lemon juice
### Instructions
##### Strawberry Sauce
1. Wash and chop the strawberries into small cubes. Grab a pot, bring together strawberry cubes, sugar and lemon juice, and mix well and keep stirring over medium heat until thickened. Transfer into a clean bowl, wrap it with plastic wrap and let it set in the fridge to cool down.
##### Mochi
1. In a clean bowl, mix well glutinous rice flour, cornstarch, sugar, milk and some red food coloring. Grab a nonstick pan, pour all the batter in, add in unsalted butter, keep stirring over medium heat until thickened and a dough ball forms. The dough ball will not stick to the pan, and the texture is quite translucent and stretchy.
2. Dust the working surface and the dough with more cooked glutinous rice flour, wear gloves; keep kneading the dough until it becomes very stretchy. Divide the dough into 6/8 equal pieces and roll them into 6/8 round flat sheets.
##### Whipped Cream
1. In a clean bowl, mix well softened cream cheese and sugar, add in heavy cream and use a hand mixer to beat until stiff peaks form. Transfer into a piping bag.
##### Assemble the mochi
1. Place the mochi dough over the mochi mold. Pipe in whipped cream, strawberry sauce in the middle, cover with more whipped cream, and wrap it up. Put it into a cupcake liner and serve.
